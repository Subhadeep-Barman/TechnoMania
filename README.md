## Abstract

A Fest Management System can help organizers plan, execute, and monitor festivals or events more efficiently and effectively by providing a centralized platform for managing all aspects of an event. This project offers features for remotely creating, removing, retrieving information, and allotting tasks to different participants in an event. It grants important access to the admin and all individuals related to a particular event, giving Event Managers access to participant lists. The system integrates modules such as Event Registration, Ticketing, Attendance Management, Budget Management, and Event Analysis. It also offers real-time communication, automated notifications, a dashboard for activity monitoring, data reporting, and analytics. The system was developed using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

## 1. Introduction

The Fest Management System is an online tool that aids event organizers in managing all aspects of their events. It streamlines the process of organizing, planning, and executing events from the initial planning stages to the final event, helping planners save time and money while providing an efficient and user-friendly platform. Features include event registration, ticketing, scheduling, and budgeting. The system allows users to select from a list of events categorized under different genres and provides functionalities for participant registration, event tracking, and financial management.

## 2. Description

Initially, users are directed to the Event Registration form, where they can view event details. The system includes student and admin login functionalities. Registered students can log in and register for events, while new users must sign up first. Admins can view and edit participant details after signing in.
